To flatten a repo to depth 1:

  git checkout master  # go to latest
  git checkout -b tmp # new branch
  git reset abc123def456  # put all content into working files. use hash of repo's first commit
  git add . 
  git commit -m 'start over' # put into repo as one commit
  git checkout master # go back
  git reset â€”hard tmp # set to commit in new branch
  git branch -D tmp # toss tmp branch

When you push to master you'll have to use flag to force non-fast-forward push, since it's destructive.
